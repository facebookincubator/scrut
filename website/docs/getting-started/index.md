**Welcome to Scrut!** Let's get you sorted.

## Requirements

- **Command Line Basics**: Scrut is a command line tool that is made to test other command line tools. That means you should have at least some cursory shell knowledge to follow along.
- **Markdown Basics**: The tests will be written in Markdown documents, to you should have some [basic understanding of Markdown syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
- **Mac / Linux ( / Windows\*)**: Besides that all you need is a Mac or Linux system and about ten minutes of your time.

:::note

\* Scrut fundamentally works on Windows, but the examples in the guides here focus on Mac / Linux terminals that run `bash`.
