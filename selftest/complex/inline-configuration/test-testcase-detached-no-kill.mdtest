# Run Detached

This test emulates an execution that accepts SIGINT or SIGHUP to abort.

## Start a long running process

```scrut {detached: true, detached_kill_signal: disabled}
$ function cleanup_int {
>     echo INT received > "$DELEGATED_TMPDIR"/signal
>     exit
> }
> function cleanup_hup {
>     echo HUP received > "$DELEGATED_TMPDIR"/signal
>     exit
> }
> function cleanup_exit {
>     echo OK > "$DELEGATED_TMPDIR"/exit
> }
> trap "cleanup_int" INT
> trap "cleanup_hup" HUP
> trap "cleanup_exit" EXIT
> echo $$ > "$DELEGATED_TMPDIR"/pid
> for i in $(seq 1 30); do
>    sleep 1
> done
```

## A test that does something

```scrut
$ echo OK
OK
```
