# Tests that fail due to tailing spaces

Show-case how Scrut highlights tailign spaces in the pretty renderer

## This first test does not fail

```scrut
$ echo foo
foo
```

## Test fails due to tailing spaces in output

```scrut
$ echo "foo   "
foo
```

## Test fails due to tailing spaces in expectation

```scrut
$ echo foo
foo   
```

## Do not highlight tailing spaces when the expectation (kind) is provided

```scrut
$ echo -e "foo\t  "
foo
```
